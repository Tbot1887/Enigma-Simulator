## C Sharp Version - Tbot1887

Hi All, I am currently making a C Sharp Version of the Enigma Machine made by Code Bullet. I have included both the **Processing** and the **C Sharp** Version.


### Running the C Sharp Version

The C Sharp version is just a windows executable. No need to install special software.
 
## Original Code Bullet README
------------------------------
So I wanted to upload the application but there was an upload limit on github so I just uploaded the code

To run it you are going to need processing, don't worry its free.
https://processing.org/download/

Then download and open the code in processing, and finally press the play button.
